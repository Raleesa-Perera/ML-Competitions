## Overview

Welcome to the Machine Learning Challenge! In this binary classification challenge, participants are tasked with predicting an individual's risk of depression based on various lifestyle and demographic factors. The primary target variable, 'Depression', indicates whether an individual is at risk (with Yes(1) or No(0) responses). The dataset contains a combination of categorical and numerical features that are intended to help identify how everyday factors could be linked to mental health risks, making it an invaluable resource for developing machine learning models aimed at predicting mental health outcomes.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following feature types:

# 10 Categorical Features : Representing various categorical inputs related to the individual's background and lifestyle.
# 9 Numerical Features : Quantitative data related to lifestyle and demographic factors.


Your Task: To develop a classifier model that predicts the likelihood of depression based on data from a mental health survey, aiming to identify key factors that may contribute to an individual's risk of experiencing depression.
