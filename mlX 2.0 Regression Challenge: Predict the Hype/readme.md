## Welcome to mlX 2.0 Regression Challenge!

In this competition, your mission is to predict a song’s popularity score (0-100) using real-world music data—from audio features and artist stats to track metadata. Using machine learning, you’ll analyze trends in danceability, energy, valence, and more to train a model that forecasts how listeners will react before a song even hits the charts.

The dataset includes real Billboard-tracked tracks, and your goal is to build the most accurate regression model possible. Can your algorithm decode the secret formula behind viral hits, or will it flop harder than a one-hit wonder?

### The Challenge:

Predict continuous popularity scores (not just hits/flops).
Uncover hidden patterns in audio and artist data.
