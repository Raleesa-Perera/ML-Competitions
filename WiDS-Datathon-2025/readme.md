## Background / Context:

The WiDS Datathon Global Challenge was developed with Ann S. Bowers Womenâ€™s Brain Health Initiative (WBHI) in collaboration with Cornell University and UC Santa Barbara. Datasets and support are provided by the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), the signature scientific initiative of the Child Mind Institute, and the Reproducible Brain Charts project (RBC).

Neuropsychiatric disorders that occur in development, like anxiety, depression, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, often differ in how and to what extent they affect males and females. ADHD occurs in about 11% of adolescents, with around 14% of boys and 8% of girls having a diagnosis. There is some evidence that girls with ADHD can often go undiagnosed, as they tend to have more inattentive symptoms which are harder to detect. Girls with ADHD who are undiagnosed will continue suffering with symptoms that burden their mental health and capacity to function.
